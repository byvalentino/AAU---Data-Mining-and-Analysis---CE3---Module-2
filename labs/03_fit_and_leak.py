"""Lab 3 — Features, and the transform that is part of the model.

Why this lab exists: a median that fills a gap and a standard deviation that
scales a column are learned constants, and a column that is filled in only once
the answer is known is not a feature. You prove here that you can fit a
transform on the training rows alone, apply the stored constants to anything
afterwards, and find the column in this archive that already knows the target.
Where it sits: Block three — "The leak in this archive", and the definition
slides "Definition — the fitted transform, and applying it" and
"Definition — target leakage, and the rule that catches it here".
What the check grades: every stored median, mean and standard deviation
(ddof = 0) equals the training rows' and nothing else's; apply_preprocessing()
returns the stored column order and moves with a test set moved by 1000, which
proves it used the stored constants; find_leaks() names every column that meets
the rule on the whole table, names neither a row identifier nor the strongest
honest feature in it, and is asked again on a frame with one guilty column
removed, where the answer is whatever the rule measures there; and
keep_or_drop() returns the right call on eight candidate features whose right
calls are not the same — four of them pure, or all but pure, and three of those
four dropped and one kept — and on eight more where one quantity has been
changed, with a reason built out of the evidence it was handed.
Needs: pandas, numpy, plotly, scikit-learn (in the demonstration only), and the loader
    in lab_support.

Twenty-five minutes.

Two ideas, and they are the same idea seen from two sides.

**The fitted transform.** A median used to fill a gap, a mean and a standard
deviation used to scale a column, the set of categories used to encode one --
these are not data cleaning. They are *learned constants*, and they belong to
the model as surely as its weights do. Learn them on the training rows only,
store them, and apply the stored ones to everything afterwards. Recompute them
on the test set and you have quietly told the model something about data it was
supposed to be judged on.

**Leakage.** A feature built from information that did not exist at the moment
of prediction. Models trained with it score beautifully and fail in service, and
a large share of the reproducibility problem in applied machine learning is this
under other names (Kapoor & Narayanan, 2023).

This lab has a real one. In the archive, `BusID` is filled in exactly when the
passenger is aboard: 7,723 rows aboard all carry it, 6,000 rows not aboard all
lack it, no exceptions. It is not a hint about the target -- it *is* the target,
wearing a different name. The generated data reproduces it as `bus_id`, because
this is the most useful thing in the whole file for teaching.

What you write: fit_preprocessing(train), apply_preprocessing(frame, fitted),
find_leaks(frame, target), and keep_or_drop(evidence).

    fit_preprocessing(train) -> dict
        Learn, from the training rows only:
          medians   {column: value} for the numeric columns you will fill
          means     {column: value} and stds {column: value} for scaling
          columns   the column order, so that applying is deterministic
        Return them in a dict. Anything not in that dict cannot be applied
        later, which is the point. Each mean and standard deviation is taken
        over the values actually present, before any fill -- fill the gaps
        with a constant first, and that constant leaks into the very numbers
        meant to describe the column before it was touched.

    apply_preprocessing(frame, fitted) -> frame
        Fill and scale using the stored constants and no others. Do not look at
        `frame` to decide what to use. Return the columns in the stored order.

    find_leaks(frame, target) -> list[str]
        Return the names of columns that predict `target` almost perfectly on
        their own -- by presence or by value, at the threshold and under the
        ceiling on the slide. Sort the names alphabetically. The columns you
        leave out are graded as hard as the ones you put in.

    keep_or_drop(evidence) -> (call, reason)
        Finding a suspect is not the same as deciding what to do about it. This
        is the decision: one candidate feature, six quantities you measured
        about it, and three possible calls -- keep it, keep it with its absence
        mask, or drop it. Return the call and the reason, and let somebody who
        was not in the room disagree with you on the evidence rather than on
        your taste.
