"""Lab 2 — Missingness is a mechanism.

Why this lab exists: more than half of the beacon readings in this archive are
absent, and the absence is caused by the very thing the reading would have told
you — distance. You prove here that you can name the mechanism, fill a gap
without destroying the record that you filled it, and measure in decibels how
much each fill invented.
Where it sits: Block two — "The mask, and why it must survive", and the
definition slides "Definition — the three missing-data mechanisms",
"Definition — the absence mask and the masked exponential moving average" and
"Definition — imputation bias".
What the check grades: for all five beacons and all three methods the mask marks
exactly the rows where the signal strength is empty or the proximity column holds
−1; "drop" leaves those rows empty, "mean" fills them with the mean of the
readings that were heard, and "ema_masked" reproduces the stated recursion on a
planted two-phone gap; imputation_bias() equals the mean of fill − truth over the
filled rows on three planted triples and on the day; and
fills_are_biased_which_way() names the direction the bias runs, which the
imputation_bias() above measures.
Needs: pandas, numpy, plotly, and the loader in lab_support.

Twenty-five minutes.

A beacon reading is absent on most rows. Before you fill anything in, one
question decides everything that follows: *why* is it absent?

  If a packet was lost in transit, the absence tells you nothing, and filling
  it with a plausible value costs little.

  If the beacon was out of range, the absence tells you where the phone was.
  Filling it with the average signal strength does not recover information --
  it invents a phone standing next to a beacon it could not hear, and it does
  so on the majority of your rows.

The second is what happens here, and in the archive: signal strength falls with
distance, so the readings that are missing are exactly the far ones. That is
missing not at random, and it is the case where imputation lies.

There is a second trap, and it is in the real file too. The same absence is
encoded twice: `rssiA` is empty and `proxA` is -1, on exactly the same rows. A
mean taken over `proxA` without recognising the sentinel averages in -1 as
though it were a real proximity band.

What you write: impute_with_mask(frame, method), imputation_bias(filled, truth,
missing), and fills_are_biased_which_way().

impute_with_mask returns a copy of `frame` with two new columns per beacon:

    <beacon>_filled     the values after imputation
    <beacon>_missing    True where the original was absent, before you filled it

The mask is not decoration. It is the only record that the value is a guess,
and every model downstream needs it. Lose it and nobody can tell a measurement
from an invention.

Three methods to support:

    "drop"        do not fill; leave the absent values absent. The mask still
                  has to be right.
    "mean"        fill with the mean of the readings that are present.
    "ema_masked"  the exponential moving average of the readings that were
                  heard, carried forward across the gaps, with the mask kept
                  (Servizi et al., 2023 -- the method this study used).

Then measure what each one invented, against the true values the check holds,
and say which way the fills are wrong before you look.
